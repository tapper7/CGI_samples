#CGI Samples

I write lots of cg code in Processing, which uses the jvm to create really cool graphics, the capabilities are limited only by the programmers imagination and coding ability/math-mind/artistic/creative aesthetic.

CGI Samples will keep the src of my favorite ones right here, feel free to add your own or change mine.
